<!-- Contact List
Putting it all together
Your task is to build an application for a user to keep track of their friends' contact information. You can work with a team or work by yourself.

Requirements
For this project you should use:

ES6 Modules with import/ export statements (don't forget to draw your module map!)
Single responsibility functions
Webpack for task automation
You can hard code your form to create contacts into your index.html file.
Project specs
Reading contacts
When the page loads, the user should see a list of all their contacts. All contacts should load from your json-server database.

Saving contacts
When the page loads, the user should see a form to enter a new contact. The a form with the following input fields:

Name
Phone number
Address
Users should be able to enter information into the form fields and click a button that says "Save". When they click the save button, the contact should be saved to the json-server database and should appear in the DOM.

Deleting Contacts
Each individual contact card should have a delete button. When the user clicks the delete button, the contact should be deleted from the database and the DOM.

Editing Contacts
Each individual contact card should have an edit button. When the user clicks the edit button, an edit form should appear with that contact's information pre-populated. When the user clicks a submit button for the edit form, the newly edited contact information should be sent to the database and refreshed in the DOM.

Modules
You should plan on building the following modules. You can build other ones in addition to these if you want to.

apiManager.js
This module shoulld handle all interactions with the database

contactList.js
This module should build and return a component for a list of all contacts. It should import and render the component from contactCard.js.

contactCard.js
This module should build and return a component for a single contact card.

editForm.js
This module should build and return a component for an edit form.

main.js
This module should contain your click events

Challenges
